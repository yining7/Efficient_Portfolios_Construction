## Construction of Efficient Portfolios using Markowitz Model

In the real world, investors are always interested in finding sets of assets that generate the highest return for the same level of risk. Emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward, Markowitz model can construct portfolios to optimize the expected return based on a given level of market risk assuming the investors are risk-averse.

Therefore, the purpose of this report is to construct efficient portfolios from the top 50 stocks in the S&P 500 index by solving the Markowitz problem. We apply CAPM and APT models to generate the expected returns and use historic co-variances for the Markowitz problem. We then delve into the Markowitz model to construct the efficient portfolios for four possible cases: with/without cash as well as with/without shorting allowed, and draw the corresponding efficient frontiers using matrix inversion and quadratic programming.
